- Each portrait is a 2:3 aspect ratio
- The width of each portrait MUST be 600px
- The CSS will slice out the sprites

Images filenames which match `leader*` are placed into the sprite sheet.
The original image is left untouched.

Requirement:

Steps:
- Use `conda env create -f environment.yml` if you do not have the environment yet.
- Activate the conda env `conda activate model-un`
- Run `python3 generate_sprites.py`
